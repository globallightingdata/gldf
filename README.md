# GLDF

**G**lobal **L**ighting **D**ata **F**ormat

GLDF is a flexible and modular **lighting data format**. With a structure, that is capable of supporting simple to complex **luminaires** and **sensors**. Developed by [DIAL](https://dial.de) and [RELUX](https://reluxnet.relux.com) to save efforts in **creation and interpretation of lighting data**.

## Features and benefits

- Allows to maintain data for [DIALux](https://www.dialux.com) and [RELUX](https://reluxnet.relux.com/de/relux-desktop.html)
  - Both applications will support this format in the future
  - DIAL and RELUX will provide applications and services, so that only one format and set of tools/libraries needs to be maintained
- Provides extensive input options, including
  - luminaires with multiple light emitters and/or sensors
  - conventional/LED light sources, with individual spectrums and emergency lighting possibilities
  - control gears, equipments and product variants
  - definition of 3d geometries in multiple level of detail
  - maintenance factors, mounting point definitions and dimming curves
  - embeded/linked files like photometries, images and documents
  - optional use of all ~350 ZVEI BIM properties (CEN/TS 17623)
  - ATEX direcives and many many more
- Is open source and free for everyone

## Current Status

About 90% of the work is done. And we are working hard to finalise the format in a first version 1.0.

However, consider the format still to be volatile and incomplete. We're still making frequently additions and change parts of it, that seem polished, to make it better. We welcome feedback from anyone who's willing to be an early-adopter with GLDF. Please use the discussion section for questions or create issues, when something seems to be wrong.

## Getting Started

The documentation is also still under development. It will be available here in the future: [gldf.io/docs](https://gldf.io/docs)
